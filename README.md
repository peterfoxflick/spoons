# Spoons

This web application is a built on node.js and is used to facilitate a game of spoons. The primary objective was to provide a working interface between the database and the user. Node turned out to be an excellent backbone for building this site. The styling is accomplished through a Bootstrap theme. The app's database is almost 100% functional, but some features are still in development. For now, you can add, drop, and start a game. Once a game begins you are assigned a target, who once you tag can input that they have been tagged. As a result, you will get that your target's target.
